# Money Management App
Since money is a thing, financial management becomes much more important. Because of some real-life problems such as unemployment or due to personal wants, a large sum of money may be needed. Therefore, the habit of saving money is required to counter these situations. As a result, an app for financial management will be needed and this is created.

## Description

This is just a app I design after learning basic Python.
